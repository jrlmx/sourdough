# My Flux Starter

The impetus for this whole project, the flux starter, was created as a breeze-esque starter kit on the TALL stack - made with Flux UI out of the box.

## Usage

Run sourdough with the following command (must be compiled first):

```bash
$ sourdough {project_name} --starter flux
```

This will create a new Laravel project, prompt you for your flux credentials, generate an auth.json file, install php/js packages, install volt and folio, and copy over the nested "stubs" folder into your project - including a basic authentication scaffold.
